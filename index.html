        <h1>My Favorite Songs</h1>
        <ul class="song-list">
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1BwFLLe233S6HR1ravS3yi?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>At the top of my song lists, 'Miss You' is one of Hyunjin's beautiful solo songs. It's a track that quickly became my all-time favorite. The song is bittersweet, filled with longing and heartache, but in the most delicate and beautiful way possible. His soft, tender voice carries so much emotion, making it feel like an emotional hug that wraps around you. Ever since I became a fan of Stray Kids, this song has been one of those songs I‚Äôve played more times than I can count. It holds a special place in my heart as one of Hyunjin‚Äôs most beautiful solo pieces. Every word feels like a piece of his heart, and the raw sadness he conveys makes it the perfect song to listen to when you're feeling reflective or just need to let your emotions flow. What makes it even more touching is knowing that he wrote this song for his past puppy. That small detail adds a deeper layer of love and grief, making the song feel even more fragile and meaningful huhuuu (‡©≠ ;¬¥ - `;)‡©≠ ‚ô°</p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="song-list">
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4C9Zhjq5ux9ieiDWYfFcfP?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>‚ÄúScars‚Äù at the second place! and once again from Stray Kids, is one of those songs that hits you right in the chest.. not because it's sad, but because it's so full of fight. It‚Äôs emotional, but also empowering. The lyrics speak about every struggle, every wound, and how those scars become a part of who you are. Not something to hide, but something that shows growth and survival. The vocals are filled with passion, and the rap lines hit with such intensity, it‚Äôs impossible not to feel the weight of their words. There's a kind of beauty in how the song blends pain with determination. It reminds me that even when things get difficult, you can keep going ‚Äî and those scars you carry? They're proof that you did. That‚Äôs what makes this song a favorite for me ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just inspiring, it‚Äôs healing in its own fierce way (‡∏á'-'ÃÅ)‡∏á</p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="song-list">
            <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1T0hdoMSjzoKUPbKRmrDg3?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
            <p>‚ÄúTwilight‚Äù feels like a fading daydream, the kind that drifts in slowly and disappears before you can hold onto it. The song carries the softness of a sky turning violet, when the world starts to quiet down and your thoughts get louder. It tells the story of someone caught in the in-between: between holding on and letting go, between daylight and night, between a memory and a goodbye. The voices feel like whispers under the stars.. not rushed, not desperate, just full of gentle longing. It brings up the feeling of missing someone without needing to say their name, or reminiscing about something beautiful that‚Äôs now just out of reach. It‚Äôs a song for slow walks, for eyes that sting a little but aren‚Äôt crying, for hearts that feel heavy but full. This song doesn‚Äôt shout, it glows quietly, like the last light before darkness falls... ‚Çä ‚äπ . ›ÅÀñ . ›Å</p>

            <p>Next! "I Like It" by Stray Kids captures the thrill of a connection that‚Äôs full of chemistry but without the need to define it. It‚Äôs about enjoying the moment and the energy between two people without rushing into labels or commitments. The playful lyrics, especially ‚ÄúI love that I like you, but I don‚Äôt wanna love,‚Äù perfectly express that carefree, exciting feeling of attraction without overthinking where it might lead. The song celebrates living in the present, embracing the fun and the spark, and letting everything unfold naturally, making it feel lighthearted yet full of intensity ‡±®‡ßé</p>
        </ul>
        <ul class="song-list">

            <p>Last one, quiet difficult for me to decide.. So, I ended up choosing "Butterflies". This song embodies that enchanting moment when you feel both overwhelmed and captivated by someone. The song captures the quiet anxiety of being in their presence, where words often fail, and the heart races uncontrollably. It's just hits different, especially for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt usually get all caught up in romantic thoughts. But this song? It‚Äôs all about that feeling you get when you can‚Äôt stop thinking about someone, and it‚Äôs like, "What‚Äôs happening? Why do I feel like my heart's beating way too fast whenever I see them?" The imagery of a butterfly‚Äîfragile yet full of life‚Äîperfectly mirrors the delicate balance of vulnerability and admiration. Each line paints a picture of being drawn into their orbit, where every glance and every movement makes the world shift slightly ( Í©ú ·ØÖ Í©ú;)</p>

                <p>‚òï ‚Äî If I had to choose one drink to carry through every version of myself, it would be coffee. I take it in different ways depending on the moment‚Äîblack when I need to think, iced when I‚Äôm trying to stay cool and sharp, sweet and milky when I just want a little comfort with a kick. Even when everything feels a bit messy or unclear, coffee always makes sense to me. I bet my friends are tired of seeing me drinking coffee daily.</p>

                <p>üçµ ‚Äî It‚Äôs not sweet‚Äînot really‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what I like about it. It‚Äôs gentle but grounded. Bitter in a way that feels honest. I‚Äôll have it when I need focus, or when I just want to slow things down and breathe for a moment.</p>

                <p>üåø ‚Äî Spicy and soothing, like warmth traveling through your chest. It‚Äôs my go-to when I need a gentle pick-me-up or a little healing. It doesn‚Äôt need to be dressed up. Just hot water, a slice or two of ginger, maybe a bit of honey if the mood calls for it.</p>

                <p>üç´ ‚Äî I‚Äôve never really had much of a sweet tooth. But I make a little exception for hot chocolate. Sometimes, on bad days or when my mood feels off, a bit of sweetness helps. Not too much, just enough to soften the edges.</p>

                <p>üí§ ‚Äî Sleep isn‚Äôt just rest ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a quiet escape where the world slows down and mind gets to drift. It‚Äôs my favorite reset button, both physically and emotionally. There‚Äôs something really comforting about wrapping myself up in a blanket and letting everything else pause. Sometimes dreams feel more peaceful than real life, and waking up refreshed just hits different.</p>

                <p>‚úçüèª ‚Äî Being busy might sound stressful to some, but for me, it means purpose. Whether I‚Äôm working on something creative, running errands, or just juggling small daily tasks, staying occupied makes me feel useful and present. I like the rhythm it brings, the sense of momentum, and that little satisfaction at the end of the day when you know you‚Äôve done something.</p>

                <p>üìñ ‚Äî Reading is a sweet little portal into someone else‚Äôs world. It‚Äôs one of those rare activities that‚Äôs quiet but thrilling, peaceful but full of motion. I love how words can paint entire universes, stirs emotions, or make me pause and think.</p>

                <p>‚ú® ‚Äî There‚Äôs something oddly therapeutic about cleaning. It‚Äôs like organizing my surroundings helps untangle my thoughts too. I love the before-and-after feeling, the way a freshly cleaned space breathes easier. It‚Äôs my way to feel grounded when things get chaotic. Plus, the scent of a clean room? Underrated joy.</p>

                <p>I‚Äôve had this small brown teddy bear since I was around six or seven‚Äîthough honestly, I can‚Äôt remember a time before it. It's a warm, soft brown; it‚Äôs still the most comforting thing I own. There‚Äôs a little stitch on one of its legs, slightly loose now. That happened back in kindergarten, and I stitched it back myself. This little bear is still my favorite and always will be.</p>

                <p>My rabbit plush is a little newer than my teddy bear. I got this red and white rabbit plush back in high school. It came into my life quietly, no big story, just suddenly there. I love to hug these plushies on days when school felt heavy or the world just felt a little too loud. It didn‚Äôt fix anything, but it made things feel a bit more bearable. Even now, although I don‚Äôt cuddle it as much as I used to, it‚Äôs still nearby.</p>
